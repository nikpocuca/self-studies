A collection of seminars/talks I have given. 

### Modeling Invidiual Claims with a CWM - Oct 2nd 2018 {-} 

*Abstract:* We propose a generalized cluster-weighted model (GCWM) that allows for modeling non-Gaussian distribution of the continuous covariates and a new zero-inflated GCWM (ZI-GCWM) for modeling insurance claims data with excess zeros.  

### Hacking Health - Oct 19th 2017 {-}

*Abstract:* Winner of the MedHacks â€“ Adherence Track at Johns Hopkins University, I will be presenting an iOS application using a neural net model.
